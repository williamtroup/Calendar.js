<h1>How do I go about customizing Calendar.js and add events?</h1>

To customize, and get more out of Calendar.js, please read through the following documentation.
<br>
<br>

### 1. Options:

Options (which can be set when initializing, or afterwards) allow you to customize how Calendar.js will look and function.  The options are also used to set the custom triggers you want to fire when specific actions occur.  You can set them manually as follows:

```markdown
<script> 
  calendarInstance.setOptions( {
      manualEditingEnabled: false,
      views: {
          fullMonth: {
              maximumEventsPerDayDisplay: 0
          }
      },
      visibleDays: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
  } );
</script>
```

To see a list of all the available options you can use, click [here](https://calendar-js.com/documentation/options.html).

<br>
<br>

### 2. Event Object Format:

An event is defined as a JavaScript object, as follows:

```markdown
<script> 
  var event = {
      from: new Date(),
      to: new Date(),
      title: "A New Event",
      description: "A description of the event"
  };
</script>
```

You can add a new event by using one of the add public functions, as follows:

```markdown
<script> 
  calendarInstance.addEvent( event );
</script>
```

### 3. Holiday Object Format:

A holiday is a piece of text that is shown under the day number in the month it is assigned to.  You can set these holidays in the options, or add them manually as follows:

```markdown
<script> 
  var holiday = {
      day: today.getDate(),
      month: today.getMonth() + 1,
      title: "A New Holiday",
  };
  
  // This is a public function that you can call
  calendarInstance.addHolidays( [ holiday ] );
</script>
```

```
